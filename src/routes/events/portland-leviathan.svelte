		In the 20th century, cities across America were scarred by urban highways â€“ and Portland Maine
		is no exception. Just as elsewhere, I-295 was routed through underserved neighborhoods and
		communities of color permanently altering the city's landscape. During this time, the city also
		experienced the destruction of the iconic Union Station, the demolition of a thriving housing
		corporation, and the eradication of Maine's largest African American community at the time.
	</p>

	<p>
		Today, Portlanders are working to undo the damage and restore our city. Many citizen campaigns
		have centered around reckoning with the legacy of I-295, by advocating for the restoration of a
		walkable human scale city and the corollary benefits of environmental justice, economic
		development, vibrancy, and beauty.
	</p>

	<p>
		The efforts have been largely supported by the city government, which is seeking two
		Reconnecting Communities grants from the U.S. Department of Transportation to repair the
		neighborhood fabric at Franklin Street and at exit 5. However, as advocates work along the
		margins, the root problem, I-295 itself, is often regarded as eternal and immutable.
	</p>

	<p class="lead pt-2">
		Portland Leviathan 2024 will look beyond isolated projects to envision a bolder, better future
		for the I-295 corridor and our city as a whole.

			The City of Portland has been in the process of rewriting its zoning code since 2017.
			Portland's city staff has now released <a
				href="https://www.recodeportland.me/second-wave-changes">a complete proposal</a
			> for these changes. Their goal is to pass these changes into law in Fall of 2024. Though updates
			to our zoning code are needed and we are supportive of some of the proposed changes, we think that
			the current proposal is insufficient to address the needs of our city today and into the future.
			The current proposal does not adequately remove barriers to addressing our housing crisis and building
			the walkable, bikeable, transit-accessible neighborhoods that will make our city a pleasant and
			environmentally sustainable place to live.
		</p>
		<p>
			We have assembled four amendments that will allow for for more middle-density, mixed-use
			neighborhoods that are pleasant to live in and move around. These changes make housing more
			affordable, encourage equity, protect the environment, make the administration of our city
			services more resilient and efficient, and bring communities closer together. All of these
			outcomes are goals laid out in Portlandâ€™s Comprehensive Plan and One Climate Future Plan.
			These amendments will not stop people from building the types of buildings they build today,
			they will just give people more options of neighborhoods to build and live in. We are
			currently in a housing affordability crisis with an environmental crisis on the horizon; the
			least we can do is allow ourselves to build the kind of city that can rise to face these
			challenges.

			To get bus routes with <strong class="text-secondary"

			we need the density to support it. Developing dense housing near transit lines, often called
			<strong class="text-secondary">Transit Oriented Development</strong>, will give us the
			ridership and tax revenue we need to get high quality transit for all of Portland. Portland's
			Comprehensive Plan and One Climate Future Plan identify key corridors that have transit today
			and were identified as places for Transit Oriented Development. Unfortunately, the newly
			proposed Transit Oriented Development zone category from the city staff's current ReCode
			proposal are not applied to these corridors at all. Instead, they are applied to just three
			specific properties in the whole city. This is spot zoning for specific projects, it is not in
			line with the comprehensive plan, and it is not nearly enough Transit Oriented Development to
			give Portland the high quality, frequent public transit it needs.

			Portland made significant progress in allowing for more housing options by <a
				href="/policy/portland_ld2003">implementing state law LD2003</a
			>. This allows for up to four units on all lots on the mainland. However, barriers to building
			denser walkable neighborhoods are still in place:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Bonuses to height and setback minimums for affordable housing do not apply in residential
				zones
			</li>
			<li>
				Setbacks, minimum lot sizes, density limits, and height limits make it difficult to build
				middle-density housing
			</li>
			<li>
				The height per story used to calculate height limits doesn't allow for the insulation needed
				for modern, green buildings
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<strong class="text-secondary"
				>We are advocating for relaxing some of these barriers to bring off-peninsula neighborhoods
				in line with some of the standards of on-peninsula residential neighborhoods like Munjoy
				Hill, Parkside, and the West End.</strong

			To build walkable neighborhoods where residents "have access to the basic necessities of daily
			life - <strong class="text-secondary"
				>high quality and affordable housing, schools and other civic functions, food, open space,
				other amenities and services - within a walkable, bikeable distance"</strong
			> we need to allow for neighborhood-scale mixture of uses within residential areas. Building these
			sorts of neighborhoods is a goal of Portland's Comprehensive Plan, which is quoted above. It is
			also a part of Portland's One Climate Future Plan and a goal of ReCode. Unfortunately, the city
			staff's current ReCode proposal does very little to expand neighborhood mixed use. The currently
			proposed changes will only effect a small handful of properties the majority of which are mixed-use
			already.

		<p>
			To build more housing we need to ensure that our city's approval process can keep up. Under
			city staff's current ReCode proposal only buildings with four units or fewer can go through
			the <strong class="text-secondary">faster, minor site plan review</strong> process. Any other building
			will be considered a major site plan whether it is 5 units or 500 units. We can also make it easier
			to determine if a project is allowed by zoning by making our zoning code simpler. Even with the
			currently proposed changes Portland has seven residential zones. Combining zones could simplify
			things for builders and reviewers alike. Lastly, the current proposal removes the option of locking
			in current zoning for a phased project. This makes it risky and complicated to build a project
			because the rules may change during the project.

				and mixed-use zones, and preserving the ability to lock in zoning for a multi-phased

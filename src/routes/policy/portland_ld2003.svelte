<h1 class="text-primary">Comply with the Spirit of LD2003</h1>

<p>
	Portland must update our land use code by January 1st 2024 to comply with the state law, LD2003.
	This law intends to expand housing opportunities but Portland's implementation adds additional
	restrictions that undermine this goal. We must amend this proposal to ensure it complies with the
	spirit of the law. You can learn more about LD2003 and the Portland Planning Staff's proposal to
	comply with it in this <a href="https://thetownsman.org/awastedopportunity/" target="_blank"
		>article in the Portland Townsman</a
	>.
</p>
<p />
<p>
	LD2003 is intended to generally allow up to four units in all residential areas. This map below
	shows the the small number of lots that will ever qualify for the full four units under Portland
	Planning Staff's current proposal:

	<p>
		We feel it is critical that we update our land use code in a way that honors the spirit of
		LD2003, however we acknowledge that our city has limited time to comply. This is why we have put
		together just four short amendments to the current planning staff proposal. Each of these
		amendments is brief and leaves code simpler than it would be if we passed the planning staff
		proposal as written. Three out of four of them are simply not adding limits to the LD2003
		allowances. The fourth just replaces the new, more restrictive rules for these units with our
		existing accessory dwelling unit (ADU) rules. These amendments are not complicated and we can
		make them without missing the January 2024 deadline. With these minor changes we will unlock the
		potential for not only more housing opportunities but the housing opportunities that are more
		affordable, more sustainable, and where we need them.
	</p>
	<p>
		Portland Planning Staff's proposal is in the form of red changes to our current land use code.
		Our proposed adjustments to their changes are in blue.

	<h3>
		Amendment 1: Do not add the limit preventing lots that were not vacant on July 1<sup>st</sup>,
		2023 from ever qualifying as vacant for LD2003
	</h3>
	<p>
		The current planning staff proposal adds a restriction to prevent lots that had a home on them
		on July 1st 2023 from ever being considered vacant for the purposes of LD2003. This restriction
		prevents these lots from qualifying for up to four units in the same structure. It limits the
		number of buildable lots that will qualify from about 28% of our city’s land to just about half
		a percent. The lots that would qualify are lots that could be built on today but aren’t. Usually
		this is because there is something about the lot that makes it unsuitable for housing. It also
		requires people to do historical research just to know what they can or can’t build. This
		restriction is overly complicated and stands in the way of not just a high quantity of housing,
		but housing in the places we need it. It should not be added to our land use code.

	<p>Changes:</p>
	<p />
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="/ld2003/1/amendment_1_use.pdf" target="_blank">Amendment 1: 6 - Use Standards</a>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>
		Amendment 2: Do not add the limit on building ADUs if you have built the units allowed by LD2003
	</h3>
	<p>
		The current planning staff proposal adds a restriction that prevents lots from qualifying to add
		accessory dwelling units (ADUs) if they have added any of the units that LD2003 entitles them
		to. This removes a lot of potential housing that could have been allowed by LD2003 because
		taking advantage of the two LD2003 units you can add to a non-vacant lot disqualifies you from
		the two ADUs you can already build. ADUs already have restrictions to control their impact, and
		if you meet them there is no reason you should be prevented from building an ADU.

	<p>Changes:</p>
	<p />
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="/ld2003/2/amendment_2_use.pdf" target="_blank">Amendment 2: 6 - Use Standards</a>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Amendment 3: Do not add additional restrictions to lots that currently have one home</h3>
	<p>
		The current planning staff proposal allows four units of housing in the same structure for
		vacant lots but only an additional two units, in different structures on lots that have a home
		on them. While this is the minimum required by LD2003 there is nothing forcing us to add those
		restrictions to lots that have a structure on them. By allowing units to be built in the same
		structure they can be built more affordably and sustainably.

			<a href="/ld2003/3/amendment_3_use.pdf" target="_blank">Amendment 3: 6 - Use Standards</a>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>
		Amendment 4: Give the additional units allowed by LD2003 the same benefits as our current ADUs
	</h3>
	<p>
		Our current accessory dwelling units (ADUs) are exempt from parking requirements, lot coverage
		maximums, and density limits. Meanwhile, the new units permitted by LD2003 have a different set
		of rules that only exempts them from density limits if they are in the same structure. While the
		units allowed by LD2003 are not the same as ADUs, the rules we have in place for ADUs work and
		there is no reason we can’t apply them to these new units as well.

    This workshop is when the proposed changes to comply with LD2003 were first announced. The changes were made available in the meeting materials
    just before the meeting and planning staff presented them to the planning board. You can read the materials [here](https://portlandme.portal.civicclerk.com/event/6414/files).
    Though some workshops do not allow public comment, this one did and several people made comments that the proposed changes were designed to change as little as possible.
    Unfortunately, the planning board appeared to be leaning towards recommending planning staff's changes to the city council, as written. You
    can read more about the meeting [here](https://thetownsman.org/awastedopportunity/). After this meeting we worked quickly to create amendments to the proposed
    changes so they could be passed before the January deadline.

      Planning Board,


      I am writing in support of the Urbanist Coalition of Portland's proposed amendments to the language proposed by the City to bring Portland into compliance with LD 2003.

      I am disappointed to see the City’s attempt to undermine the impact of LD 2003.

      These proposed rules are overly complicated at a time when Portland is supposed to be simplifying its code.

      Confusion around navigating these complicated new rules will discourage the average homeowner from taking advantage of these new allowances, the very people that LD 2003 is meant to empower to create new housing on their own property.

      Local resistance to housing creation is the root cause of the housing affordability crisis we’re experiencing today, the same local resistance that has forced the state to intervene.

      Portland is not exempt from the statewide need to allow new housing. On the contrary: Portland’s status as our state’s hub for healthcare, tourism, and services for homeless and refugee communities makes the need for additional housing in Portland more urgent than perhaps anywhere else in Maine. Without more housing, Portland’s workers are forced into long commutes; Portland’s seniors are not able to age in place; Portland’s young people are forced to move elsewhere in search of a lower cost of living; our refugees go unhoused and our most vulnerable are living in tents.   

      The City’s proposed changes will not create the new housing supply we desperately need – we must comply with LD 2003 and amend the proposed changes to allow 4 units in all mainland residential zones.

      I urge the City to adopt the amendments proposed by the Urbanist Coalition of Portland. The amendments simplify the City’s proposed language and would: 

      1. Allow lots that become vacant after July 1, 2023 to build 4 units,
      2. Allow ADUs on lots that have built the newly allowed units,
      3. Allow 4 units on lots with an existing home without requiring its demolition, and
      4. Give the newly allowed units the same exemptions currently given to ADUs (exemptions from parking minimums, lot coverage maximums, and density limits)

      A complete comparison of the original ordinance, the City’s proposed changes, and UCP’s proposed amendments to these changes may be found at urbanistportland.me/policy/portland_ld2003.


      Sincerely,


      [Your Name]

    Thanks to public feedback Planning Staff has added amendment 2 and some elements of amendment 3 into their proposal. At this meeting, the Planning Board voted to recommend this version to the City Council. This is an important step in the right direction and we are happy these changes were made. This demonstrates that these changes make sense and advocating for them can bring about real change. However, there is still more work to be done. The vast majority of lots still will never qualify for the full four units, our zoning code will get new and complicated rules to achieve this. Without some of the exemptions we currently give to ADUs to allow them to be built in our residential zones it may be difficult to actually get these units built.

    Before the council can vote on something it has to be read at a previous city council meeting. This makes sure everyone is informed there is time to consider each vote.
    No public comment is taken for these first readings, but it can be interesting to listen to.

      City Council,

      I am writing in support of the Urbanist Coalition of Portland's proposed amendments to the language proposed by the City to bring Portland into compliance with LD 2003.

      I am disappointed to see the City’s attempt to undermine the impact of LD 2003.

      The proposed language adds new and complicated rules to limit the housing potential of LD2003 at a time when Portland is desperately in need of housing and supposed to be simplifying its code.

      Confusion around navigating these complicated new rules will discourage the average homeowner from taking advantage of these new allowances, the very people that LD 2003 is meant to empower to create new housing on their own property.

      Local resistance to housing creation is the root cause of the housing affordability crisis we’re experiencing today, the same local resistance that has forced the state to intervene.

      Portland is not exempt from the statewide need to allow new housing. On the contrary: Portland’s status as our state’s hub for healthcare, tourism, and services for homeless and refugee communities makes the need for additional housing in Portland more urgent than perhaps anywhere else in Maine. Without more housing, Portland’s workers are forced into long commutes; Portland’s seniors are not able to age in place; Portland’s young people are forced to move elsewhere in search of a lower cost of living; our refugees go unhoused and our most vulnerable are living in tents.   

      The City’s proposed changes will not create the new housing supply we desperately need – we must comply with LD 2003 and amend the proposed changes to allow 4 units in the entire area we chose as our growth area; all mainland residential zones.

      One amendment, and part of another, that were proposed by the Urbanist Coalition of Portland have already been incorporated into the recommendation from the Planning Board. This is an important step in the right direction and demonstrates that these amendments can be added in time for our deadline to comply with LD2003. However, the current proposal is still seriously flawed.

      I urge the City to adopt the remaining amendments proposed by the Urbanist Coalition of Portland. The amendments simplify the City’s proposed language and would:

        - Amendment 1: Allow lots that become vacant after July 1, 2023 to build 4 units.
        - Amendment 3: Allow 4 units on lots with an existing home without requiring its demolition.
        - Amendment 4: Give the newly allowed units the same exemptions currently given to ADUs (exemptions from parking minimums, lot coverage maximums, and density limits).
